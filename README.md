## Ques:
1. First take an array and an object:
```
cost = [100, 200, 300];

const person = {
  name: "Khairul",
  salary: 50000
};

```
2. Remove the first element from the array and add 500 at the end by using JavaScript Destructuring method.

3. Remove the name from the person object and add a tax property (10).

4. Write a function totalCost() to calculate the sum of the updated cost array.

5. Write a function wages() that calculates the remaining salary after tax and expenses.
